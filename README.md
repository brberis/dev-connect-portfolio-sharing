# Dev Connect


## Description

Dev Connect is a social media for developers. Our project combines features popular on other social networks, such as sharing posts, creating your own profile, and connecting with other professionals. With the added spin that our site is set up specifically for developers to be able to easily share their work with their friends and colleagues. Dev connect is like a mashup between linkedin, github, and instagram all rolled into one user friendly website.
Our app is a social media specifically for developers. Allowing users to create an account with a customizable avatar, post projects they've been working on, and comment on each otherâ€™s work.

Our motivation for development came from seeing github as a great place to share code, but not easy to share with all of your colleagues at once, so we added aspects that we like on other social media websites. We want our users to be able to share there work in a smoother and more concise way. Our website was created for developers but is also easy to use for friends and family that may not be so tech savvy but are interested in learning more.
The technologies used within our project include html, javascript, css,  handlebars, dotenv, bcrypt, sequelize, mysql, jest, textclipper, trix, amd express.
